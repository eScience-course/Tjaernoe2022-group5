    "The polar regions are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and energy flux due to different positive feedback mechanisms. As a result of this sensitivity, the polar regions warm faster than the global mean temperature, an effect also known as Polar amplification (e.g., Manabe and Wetherald, 1975). The surface albedo feedback describes one of the main effects of a positive enhancement of temperature increase and was first described by Arrhenius in 1896. With rising temperatures, ice and snow will melt and decrease the albedo in high latitudes, resulting in higher absorption of radiation and temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing downward longwave radiation was found to play an important role regarding sea ice retreat. In die Arctic horizontal moisture transported and warm air advection from lower latitudes are the main cause for an increase in the downward longwave radiation (D.-S. R. Park et al. 2015). Woods et al. (2013) found that small and thin but intense moisture injections are the main driver of variance in arctic mean surface air temperature and downward longwave radiation. In Antarctica, moist and warm air intrusions are considered to play a critical role in surface melting on major ice shelves due to an increase in integrated water vapor and cloud liquid and ice water content. \n",
    "\n",
    "These intense moisture injections are also known as Atmospheric rivers (AR) which are vapor rich meridional air masses originating from the tropics or subtropics. An atmospheric river is defined as 'A long, narrow, and transient corridor of strong horizontal water vapor transport that is typically associated with a low-level jet stream ahead of the cold front of an extratropical cyclone' (Glossary of Meteorology, 2020). ARs are responsible for over 90 % of meridional vapor transport in the mid latitudes (Nash et al., 2018). In polar regions ARs perturb the usually thermodynamically stable systems and enhance temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover and can change the aerosol number concentration and size distribution (Dada et al., 2022; Wille et al., 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Arctic, the frequency of AR occurence increased in the past decades (Dada et al., 2022). With a changing climate and polar amplification, the influcence of ARs on the polar systems might change from the effects that are seen now. To investigate the role of polar ARs in the future\n",

    "**Atmospheric River Detection Algorithm** The basis for the atmospheric river detection algorithm (ARDA) used in this work was developed by Willie et al. () and adapted for this project during data analysis. Atmospheric rivers are detected via a threshold for integrated water vapor (IVT) multiplied with the meridional wind component. The threshold is defined by calculating the 94th quantile of IVT in every grid cell of the historical data. An atmospheric river is then only detected if a cluster of connected grid cells over 20 ° lat exceed the calculated threshold. The code for the ARDA in this project was written by Rémy Lapere. "
