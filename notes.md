-Can we look at different species to relate to different sources (like anthropogenic/natural)?
-Look at different scenarios
-Antarctic and Arctic, consider the differences in role of AR (ex: well established importance for precipitation in Antarctic)

-Does the ratio between clean and polluted AR change from current climate to future projections?
-Does the frequency of AR change?
-How much aerosol is transported to the poles with AR, and what is the trend in projections?
