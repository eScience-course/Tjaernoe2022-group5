-Can we look at different species to relate to different sources (like anthropogenic/natural)?
-Look at different scenarios
    -ssp245, 370, 585
-Antarctic and Arctic, consider the differences in role of AR (ex: well established importance for precipitation in Antarctic)
-Look at sensitivity runs (what is the sensitivity of precipitation due to AR on e.g. dust doubling)

-Does the ratio between clean and polluted AR change from current climate to future projections?
-Does the frequency of AR change?
-How much aerosol is transported to the poles with AR, and what is the trend in projections?
-Can we validate the AR detection product for CMIP6 against ERA5 data?

-What is the impact of AR on polar aerosols and clouds and how will it change in the future?
